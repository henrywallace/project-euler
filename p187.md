First, as with our example, let our bound $m = 30$. Each composite must have exactly two prime divisors: $n = pq$. Let $p < q$. To find the number of composites, we count the number $n$ with $p = 2, 3, 5, 7, \ldots$ Let $i$ be the index of $p$ in the list of primes, and $j$ be the index of the largest prime $p$ it could product with, $Q = \lfloor m/p \rfloor$. The number of composites is then $\sum_{p_i^2<m}(j-i+1)$. To find $j$, we simply use a binary search.

Now, what is the runtime? We Now, what is the runtime of this? We need to generate a list of primes bounded by $b = \lfloor m/2 \rfloor$, the largest $Q$. We'll use the Sieve of Eratosthenes for a runtime: $\log \log b$. Then we do $\sqrt{m}$ binary searches on a set with size $k$, where $k$ is the number of primes less than $b$. The prime number theorem gives this to be $k = \frac{b}{\log b}$. The total runtime is then
$$ \log\log b \cdot \sqrt{m} (\log b - \log\log b) = O(\sqrt{b}(\log b - \log^2 \log b))
